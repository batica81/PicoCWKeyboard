Basic purpose of the app is to take input from serial port and turn it into Morse code.
Then it plays it via sound, light or by acting as a straight key and triggering an external device (radio).
Interfacing with the external device can be done with an optocupler, transistor, relay or similar simple circuit.
There is one memory slot that can be played with a button push, and changed through console.
WPM and sidetone frequency can be changed as well.
